A utility for testing whether or not a network range exhibits traits of an aliased network range. 
Aliased network ranges are ranges in which every host responds to a ping request, thereby making 
it look like the range is full of IPv6 hosts. Pointing this utility at a network range will let 
tell you whether or not that network range is aliased and, if it is, the boundary of the network 
range that is aliased.
